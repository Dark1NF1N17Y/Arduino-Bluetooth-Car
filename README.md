# Arduino Bluetooth Car

Arduino Pro Bluetooth Car Built And Programmed By Me

- Bluetooth Car Controlled By Mobile Phone ( Terminal APK That Sends Bluetooth Commands )

- Command `h` For Help Menu

- Added Horn And Front Light As You See In The Project Design

- Turn On And Off The Front Light Using 1 Command

- Soon AutoPilot Command!!

- I Din't Find IR Sensor In The Website So I Changed It With Gaz Detection As A Sensor

- On Invalid Input Or Something Blocks It Prints On The Screen
